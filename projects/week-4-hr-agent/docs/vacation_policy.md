# Acme Corporation Vacation and Time Off Policy

## Overview

Acme Corporation believes that time away from work is essential for employee well-being and productivity. This policy outlines our paid time off (PTO) benefits.

## Paid Time Off (PTO)

### PTO Accrual

Full-time employees accrue PTO based on years of service:

| 6-10 years | 25 days | 2.08 days/month |
| 10+ years | 30 days | 2.50 days/month |

PTO begins accruing on your first day of employment. New employees may use accrued PTO after completing 90 days of employment.
