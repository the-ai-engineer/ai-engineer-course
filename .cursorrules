# Cursor Rules for AI Engineer Course

## Project Context
This is an educational course teaching AI engineering from first principles.
Code should be clear, simple, and demo-friendly.

## Code Style

### Python
- Use Python 3.11+ features
- Simple, readable code over clever code
- Each file should demonstrate ONE key concept
- Keep files under 150 lines when possible
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use docstrings for modules and key functions

### Formatting
- Use ruff for formatting (88 char line length)
- Double quotes for strings
- Imports at top, stdlib first, then third-party

### Comments
- Explain WHY, not WHAT
- Use section headers for code organization:
  ```python
  # =============================================================================
  # Section Name
  # =============================================================================
  ```

### Naming
- snake_case for functions and variables
- PascalCase for classes
- UPPER_CASE for constants
- Descriptive names over abbreviations

## What NOT to do
- No emojis in code (use [OK], [FAIL] for status)
- No overly complex examples
- No unnecessary abstractions
- No f-strings without substitutions
- No print statements without purpose

## Code Examples Should Be
- Runnable as standalone scripts
- Self-contained (minimal dependencies)
- Well-commented for teaching
- Easy to modify and experiment with

## File Structure
```
module-N/
├── 0-introduction.md     # Module overview
├── lessons/              # Markdown lessons for Skool
├── N-topic.py            # Runnable code examples
├── pyproject.toml        # uv dependencies
└── env-sample            # Environment template
```

## When Writing Code
1. Start with a docstring explaining the concept
2. Use clear section headers
3. Show the simplest working example first
4. Add complexity only if it teaches something new
5. End with a runnable demo if appropriate
